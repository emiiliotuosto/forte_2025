Title:
a. A Coordination Model Inspired by Smart Contracts
b. Automata for smart contracts...and more
c. Playing on Smart Contracts with a Formal Framework
d. A Formal Framework for Data-Aware Coordination of Distributed Components

Abstract:
This tutorial will showcase a recent model for distributed coordination that blends together ideas from  smart contracts, choreographic modelling of message-passing systems, and global types and typestates to formalise distributed interactions. Our framework is based on symbolic finite-state machines to holistically capture interaction protocols. These abstract automata --akin global types or global specifications of choreographies-- allow us to focus on general properties of interest, while abstracting away from run-time details such as the number of actual components executing the protocol. This approach allows us to easily formalise sophisticated protocols. A distinguished feature of the model is that it allows us to represent data-dependency. This is a quintessential aspect to handle properties that depend on the payloads of components' interactions such as in smart contracts.

The tutorial will show how to formalise interaction protocols using our automata and analyse some properties of interest using TRAC, a tool designed to support our approach.

The content of this tutorial is the result of a joint collaboration with Maurizio Murgia (GSSI), Ant√≥nio Ravara (NOVA, Lisbon), and Elvis Konjoh Selabi (UniCam and GSSI).
