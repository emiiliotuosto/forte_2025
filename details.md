Abstract:
A recent coordination model blends together ideas from smart contracts, choreographies, and typestates to formalise and reason about interactions of distributed components. Our framework is based on symbolic finite-state machines dubbed DAFSMs (after Data-Aware Finite-State Machines) to holistically capture coordination protocols, which can be thought of a sort of smart contracts. Akin global specifications such as global types, DAFSMs allow us to define properties of interest, while abstracting away from run-time details such as the number of actual components executing the protocol. Interestingly DAFSMs can represent data-dependency. This is a quintessential aspect to handle properties that depend on the payloads of components' interactions such as those typical in smart contracts.

The tutorial will show how to use DAFSMs to formalise coordination protocols and analyse some properties of interest using a Tool for Resource-Aware Coordination (TRAC, https://github.com/loctet/TRAC), designed to support our approach.

This tutorial is based on joint work with Elvis Konjoh Selabi (UniCam and GSSI), Maurizio Murgia (GSSI), and Ant√≥nio Ravara (NOVA, Lisbon).
